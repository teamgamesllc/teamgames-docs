# FAQ

## My Team member is not being added onto payments, what should I do?

Please make sure that the Team member has a TeamGames account. Afterwards make sure that the Team member has a valid PayPal account connected to their account. Last the username needs to be the username (and not an email address) of the Team member. They can provide their username by going to the Creator's Dashboard it will be next to their profile picture.
